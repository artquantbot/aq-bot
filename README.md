Quantitative intelligence bot. Art meets markets.
# ArtQuantBot

ArtQuantBot is a quantitative intelligence bot designed to reason about markets
using probability, risk, and structured judgment rather than single-point predictions.

## Philosophy
Markets are not deterministic.
ArtQuantBot does not predict — it evaluates.

Core principles:
- Probability over certainty
- Risk before return
- Confidence bands instead of absolute answers

## What this repository is
This repository represents the core logic and conceptual foundation of ArtQuantBot.

At this stage, it focuses on:
- Architecture design
- Decision logic scaffolding
- Experimental quantitative ideas

## Status
Early-stage research and experimentation.
